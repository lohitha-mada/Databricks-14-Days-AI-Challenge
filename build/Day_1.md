##🚀 Day 1 – Getting Started with Databricks

Today I officially kicked off my Databricks learning journey as part of the Databricks 14 Days AI Challenge.
I spent most of the day getting familiar with the platform and understanding why Databricks is so widely used in modern data engineering and analytics.

This day was focused on building a strong foundation before diving into deeper Spark and AI concepts.

💡 What I Learned Today
🔹 What is Databricks?

Databricks is a cloud-based unified analytics platform built on top of Apache Spark.
It is designed to handle large-scale data engineering, analytics, and machine learning workloads efficiently.

It provides a single platform where teams can work collaboratively using SQL, Python, Scala, and R.

🔹 Why Databricks over Pandas and Hadoop?

Pandas is great for small datasets but is limited to single-machine processing.

Hadoop introduced distributed systems but comes with complex setup and slower disk-based processing.

Databricks stands out because it:

Uses in-memory distributed computing (faster processing)

Scales easily for big data

Simplifies infrastructure management

Supports end-to-end analytics on one platform

This makes Databricks a preferred choice for large-scale, real-world data workloads.

🔹 Lakehouse Architecture (Basics)

The Lakehouse architecture combines the best features of:

Data Lakes → flexibility and low-cost storage

Data Warehouses → performance and reliability

This approach enables analytics, BI, and machine learning on a single source of truth.
